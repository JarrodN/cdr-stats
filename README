CDR-Stats 
-----------

    CDR-Stats is a CDR viewer for Asterisk/Freeswitch Call Data Records. It allows you to 
    interrogate your CDR to provide reports and statistics via a simple to 
    use, yet powerful, web interface.

    It is based on the Django Python Framework which enables the building 
    of clean, maintainable web applications, and encourages rapid 
    development with clean and pragmatic design.

    Star2Billing S.L. is the company behind the development of CDR-Stats, and 
    was originally formed to provide a revenue stream to support the popular 
    open source A2Billing Telecom Switch and Billing System by providing 
    professional support, installation and consultancy services.
